# generating-images-gan
An image generating model after learning from the dataset using GANs. 

all functions imported from pytorch 
Gans do take a while to train and results may be varying

in the gan mnist file, the number of epochs plays a role in generating discernible images, run upto 50k - 100k epochs for readable images, lower number of epochs will just result in noise
